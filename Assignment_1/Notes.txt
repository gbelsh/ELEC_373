1. Simulation Setup
    • Choose one programming language to do the simulation from C/C++, Matlab, Python, and Java.
    • Implement a simulation of a single-server queue system.
    • Ensure that both packet inter-arrival times and service times follow a geometric distribution.
    • The service rate (μ) of the system is fixed at 0.75.

2. Parameter Variation
    • Conduct simulations for various packet arrival rates (λ). Specifically, 
    use the following λ values: 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.72, 0.74, and 0.745.

3. Data Collection
    • For each value of λ, run the simulation for at least 106 time slots.
    • For each value of λ, keep track of the queue length, compute 
    the average queue length, and obtain the average queueing delay 
    by using Little’s law formula.

4. Analysis and Theoretical Comparison
    • Plot the expected queueing delay against the arrival rate (λ) 
    based on your simulation results.
    • Using the formula derived from the single-server queue analysis, 
    plot the theoretical curve of expected queueing delay as a function 
    of arrival rate (λ).
    • Overlay this theoretical curve with your empirical plot to compare 
    the simulation results with theoretical expectations
